          describes how Bastion collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you visit or use

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[#185a7d]"> Types of Information We Collect</h2>
        <p class="font-light"> When you visit and browse the Website or Apps, we are able to collect information that
          could be reasonably
          used
          to
          indirectly identify you individually, such as your physical location, the device you are using and the
          Internet
          Service Provider (ISP) you are using. We can also record the date, time, and pages visited while you are at
          our
          site
          and the type of web browser and operating system you use. We do this to determine how individuals use the
          Website
          and services so that we can enhance a user’s experience and make the Website and services more useful for
          customers.</p>

        <p class="font-light"> When you request information or make an application for services, we collect personally
          identifiable
          information
          that you provide to us directly, such as by completing an online form, application, field, or survey.
          Personally
          identifiable information means information that directly identifies you or can be used to directly identify
          you.
          Examples may include your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, date of birth, social security
          number,
          driver’s license number, and account numbers. We will retain your personal information for as long as your
          account
          is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply
          with
          our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
        <p class="font-light">
          In addition to the personal information described above, we also collect anonymous demographic information,
          which
          is
          not unique to you, such as your zip code, region, preferences, interests, and favorites. When you use our
          online
          or
          mobile banking services, you also may be required to enter information we believe is necessary to safely
          process
          your transaction, such as your digital banking Login ID and password.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[#185a7d]">How We Collect Information</h2>
        <p class="font-light"><b>Browser Cookies –</b> Cookies are pieces of data that are stored directly on your
          computer, smartphone, or
          other
          internet access device. They are assigned by a web server to the browser on your device and allow us to
          recognize
          your device and store user preferences for when you return to the Website. Information gathered through the
          use
          of
          cookies may be used to make offers to you via online ads, email, U.S. mail or telephone, subject to the
          privacy
          preferences you have on file with Bastion. We do not embed your Social Security number, account number(s), or
          passwords into our cookies. Cookies we use do not contain or capture unencrypted personal information. You can
          refuse to accept these cookies and most devices and browsers offer their own cookie privacy settings. You’ll
          need
          to
          manage your cookie settings for each device and browser you use. If you do not accept these cookies or clear
          cookies
          regularly, your experience while visiting our website may be less than optimal. For online and mobile banking
          users,
          non-acceptance or removal of cookies will require a new secure access code for each session.</p>

        <p class="font-light"><b>IP Address –</b> Your IP Address is a number automatically assigned to the device
          you’re using by your
          Internet
          Service
          Provider (ISP). An IP address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user
          visits
          the Website, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collection of IP addresses is
          standard practice on the internet and is done automatically by many websites. We use IP addresses for purposes
          such
          as calculating site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, to personalize/tailor your experience
          while
          engaging with us online and offline, for compliance and security purposes, for advertising and administering
          the
          Website. The Controls & Alerts App periodically collects, transmits, and uses geolocation information to
          enable
          features that prevent fraudulent card use and to send alerts, but only if the End User expressly authorizes
          the
          collection of such information. Geolocation information can be monitored on a continuous basis in the
          background
          only while the App is being used or not at all, depending on the End User’s selection. End Users can change
          their
          location permissions at any time in their device settings.</p>

        <p class="font-light"><b>Aggregated Data –</b> Aggregated Data is data that we may create or compile from
          various sources,
          including
          but
          not
          limited to, accounts and transactions. We use this information, which does not identify individual account
          holders,
          for our business purposes, which may include offering products or services, research, marketing, or analyzing
          market
          trends and other purposes consistent with applicable laws.</p>

        <p class="font-light"><b>Social Media Sites –</b>

          Bastion has a presence on social media platforms including, but
          not limited to,
          Facebook,
          Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+ that enable online sharing and collaboration among users who have registered to
          use
          such sites. Any content, such as pictures, information, or opinions that you post on social media pages, or
          any
          Personal Information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to
          the
          terms of use and privacy of those hosting platforms.
        </p>

        <p class="font-light"><b>Do Not Track Signals (“DNT”) –</b> Do Not Track Signals refer to an HTTP header used by
          Internet web
          browsers
          to
          request
          a web application disable its tracking or cross-site user tracking. When DNT is enabled, a user’s web browser
          adds
          a
          header to content requests indicating that the user does not want to be tracked. California law requires us to
          disclose how we respond to web browser DNT signals. We do not respond to or take any action with respect to a
          DNT
          configuration set in your internet browser, and therefore, do not disable tracking.</p>

        <p class="font-light"><b>Social Security Numbers –</b> As required by law, in the normal course of business,
          Bastion collects
          Social
          Security
          numbers in establishing, maintaining, and servicing member accounts. We implement reasonable measures to
          protect
          the
          confidentiality of Social Security numbers, to prohibit unlawful disclosure of Social Security numbers, and to
          limit
          access to Social Security numbers.</p>
