              <p class="text-gray-700 font-light">As a business owner, thinking about the economy is part of the job.
                Inflation, recession, job growth, wages, etc., all factor into how you do business. Lately, the rise in
                federal interest rates is a hot topic and you may be wondering how this will affect your business.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 font-light">The Fed has been increasing rates on a regular basis in 2022 to cool
                off inflation and slow down the economy to a more manageable level. When federal interest rates are
                high, it becomes more expensive to do things like borrow money or carry debit. In turn, this can
                decrease consumer demand, bringing prices back in check and alleviating strain on supply chains.</p>

                <p class="font-light text-gray-700">For the last few years, interest rates have been at near all-time
                  lows, mostly to help soften the economic impact of the pandemic. Just look at the housing market and
                  the demand for cars—lower interest rates spur purchase and consumption. It also drives inflation,
                  which is why the Fed wants to pump the brakes.
                </p>
                <p>When it becomes more expensive to borrow money, demand is cooled, and inflation may slow down. But it
                  also means that businesses’ ability to borrow is diminished. Businesses often rely on borrowed money
                  from loans, credit cards and lines of credit to help finance their growth. Large purchases such as new
                  equipment or real estate, or long-term upgrades and investments may be put on hold due to higher
                  interest rates. Payments on current variable rate loans will also go up.
                </p>
                <p>Higher rates can also lead to loan applications being reviewed with greater scrutiny. Because it
                  costs more for financial institutions to borrow money from each other, lending standards become more
                  stringent. Having a good relationship with your lender can ease this process. That personal connection
                  builds trust on both sides: your lender trusts you to fulfill your financial obligations, and you
                  trust your lender to better understand and help with your long-term financial needs. Bastion functions

                <p>Because it is a transactional account, funds can flow in and out quickly. It can sometimes be hard to

                Operation</h1>
              <p class="font-light text-gray-700">It’s no secret that rising interest rates affect more than just loans
                or credit cards, cascading through the economy in the form of increased prices for goods and services.
                Costs for raw materials and supplies are climbing, and lead times are getting longer. Wages and
                healthcare costs are also on the rise, and offering competitive wages and benefits is crucial to
                retaining your employees. Even where you do business is affected by rising real estate prices and rents.
              </p>
              <p class="font-light text-gray-700">As a business owner, you may be faced with a tricky balancing act
                between absorbing these costs to avoid increasing prices and driving customers away, and still
                maintaining a profitable business capable of growth. It may be time to take an in-depth look at your
                business and search for ways to reduce costs and streamline operations that could help your business
                save some money each month.

            Challenges</h1>
          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Rising interest rates on your loans can diminish your cashflow, as your
            costs go up and the dollar amount on loan payments increases. This can lead to less day-to-day cash
            stability and reduce the ability to invest in long term growth. Bastion provides a suite of Cash Management
            Solutions to help you navigate these challenges.
          </p>
          <p>If you’ve been able to keep some cash on hand, you may be able to ride out these interest rate increases.
            If you’re a newer business owner that may not have that cash or enough data to plan for economic ups and
            downs yet, you may want to proceed with caution until the market levels off. Talking to our business team
            can help you make the decisions that are best for you and your business.
          </p>
          <p>Inflation can also make it difficult to build up cash reserves, so it’s wise to have a plan to set
            something aside whenever you can, easing potential bumps in the road. Small amounts add up over time, and
            once you have accumulated some savings, our financial experts can show you how to maximize those funds with
            investing and wealth management tools geared for business.</p>

          <h1 class="mt-2 text-xl font-bold leading-8 tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-xl">Changes in Consumer
            Behavior
          </h1>
          <p>Interest rates affect everyone eventually. This includes your customers, who are likely to spend less when
            interest rates are higher and their cost of credit and borrowing goes up. Businesses based on financed
            products, such as equipment, real estate, or vehicles, may find their customers hitting pause on purchasing.
            Your customers could be having the same challenges obtaining credit as lending standards tighten. Services
            dependent on more discretionary spending, such as luxury products, dining out, or marketing services, are
            also prone to changes in consumer demand as customers cut back on optional spending. As a consumer yourself,
            think about how your own personal finances have been affected over the last several years and how it has
            changed your spending priorities.</p>
          <p>Businesses based on non-discretionary spending, such as medical, dental, and veterinary practices need to
            keep pace with what consumers want and need, and that requires investment. Expanding service offerings,
            adding new products, and hiring additional staff to meet these needs come at a cost. Maintaining the
            standards your customers have come to expect while continuing to grow your business can put a strain on
            finances, but Bastion’s highly competitive business loan rates can give your room to breathe.</p>

          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Rising federal interest rates can take months to move through the economy
            and the effects aren’t always immediately predictable. Now is the time to take another look at your
            business, determine where you can streamline costs and find opportunities to secure the future. Your
            business will be better prepared to face small downturns and economic changes.
          </p>
          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">And if you do have available cash in accounts that aren’t doing much for
            you, these rising interest rates mean there’s more competition for your money.</p>
          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">The average bank savings rate is now just 0.11%, up from 0.06% in January,
            per Bankrate.com. The average rate on a one-year CD is 0.51%, up from 0.14% at the start of the year.</p>
          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Bastion is committed to serving our members by offering higher rates and
            increasing them as benchmark rates increase. This could mean greater returns on things like Business Money
            Markets and Business Certificates (known as certificates of deposit or CDs at other financial institutions).
            While you shouldn’t expect a windfall of cash, it can help offset additional costs and allow you to further
            invest in your business future.</p>

            multimillion-dollar medical group. Without a good understanding of finance and professional help, things can
            be much harder than necessary.
