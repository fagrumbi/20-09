                feel daunting. There’s a lot to remember and a lot of factors to consider while filing. The American tax
                system, for instance, involves around 800 forms—some with convoluted rules and requirements. And another
                layer of complication has been added during the pandemic, as rapid changes in finances and incomes have
                occurred, and things like stimulus checks have been introduced.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 font-light">Luckily, there are plenty of resources, like this tax checklist,
                available to ensure that filing goes
                smoothly this year. Below are a few key things to keep in mind as you approach the 2022 tax season.</p>

                <p class="font-light text-gray-700">This may seem obvious, but filing your taxes by the due date is
                  incredibly important. There are two
                  main penalties in place if you’re unable to meet the deadline: the failure to file penalty and the
                  failure to pay penalty. Both of these can add up to 25% of your taxes owed, meaning that you’ll be
                  paying significantly more if you miss the deadline.</p>
                <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Avoiding these penalties is easy: just set a reminder in your
                  calendar and remember to file your
                  taxes by April 18. However, if this date seems unattainable, filing for extensions is possible, and
                  can give you a bit more breathing room.</p>

                <p>Not knowing your personal information and the types of taxes you have to pay or claims you are able
                  to file is a common mistake. There are a few key pieces of personal information you should know before

                Prepare for Any Increases in Your Taxes</h1>
              <p class="font-light text-gray-700">While filing your basic tax returns can be straightforward if you’re
                only receiving one income from a single employer, it can get a little complicated if you have other
                means of income to declare. For instance, your taxes may increase if you are receiving rental income,
                stocks and shares, or even a salary from secondary employment. Any additional means of income need to
                be declared for tax purposes and you will more than likely have to prepare yourself for a tax increase
                to account for these.</p>

            Determine if You’re Eligible for Deductions</h1>
          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Increases in income from selling your house or getting a raise will
            increase the amount you pay in your taxes. However, there are some factors of your life which may qualify
            you to deduct amounts from your taxes as well. Keeping these in mind will help you to save money on the
            amount owed on your taxes.</p>
          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Tuition costs, donations to charities, tax forgiveness credit, Health
            Savings Account contributions,
            mortgage interest payments, and student loans can impact your taxes in a positive way. Be sure to look at
            which deductions you qualify for as part of your tax filing prep in order to pay the optimal amount and save
            as much as you can.

            Check Your Information
          </h1>
          <p>Before you file your taxes, be sure to double-check your math and the information on your forms, or consult
            with an expert on them. Ensuring that you are filing your taxes properly and error-free will save you issues
            in the long run.</p>
          <p>Although it seems like a lot to remember, having a tax checklist is a great place to start. Instead of
            being intimidated by the complex U.S. tax system, approach your taxes systematically and give yourself
            enough time to check over your claims. There is also the option to talk to local financial experts in order
            to provide some reassurance that your taxes are getting done right this year.</p>
