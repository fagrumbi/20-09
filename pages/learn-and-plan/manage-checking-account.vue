                check, you still need a checking account. Having a checking account makes it much easier to get paid and
                pay your bills. Your debit card enables you to access money through ATM withdrawals and online
                transfers.

              <p class="text-gray-700 font-light">At some point, everyone will need to open a checking account, so it’s
                important to how to use one. Here’s a few easy-to-follow tips and rules to keep in mind when opening and

                  worth having a clear understanding of exactly what you intend to get out of your account. Some things
                  to consider when choosing a checking account include:
                </p>
                <div>
                  <p> ✔ Is there any minimum balance required to open an account?</p>
                  <p> ✔ Are there any limitations on checks or debit transactions?</p>
                  <p>✔ Do you want a checking account with or without overdraft protection?</p>
                  <p>✔ How much does it cost to use this account on a monthly, yearly, or per transaction basis?</p>
                  <p>✔ How much money is needed to open a checking account that pays interest?</p>
                </div>

                  Records</h1>
                <p>Because it is a transactional account, funds can flow in and out quickly. It can sometimes be hard to
                  keep track of them all, and if you don’t know what’s going in and out of your account, it will be
                  difficult to manage it. While it might seem tedious, recording each transaction made will not only
                  allow you to manage your account properly, but also instill good financial discipline.

                Information Protected</h1>
              <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Unfortunately, financial fraud remains a reality in our world. Don’t
                take the safety of your account information, especially your PIN numbers and online banking passwords,
                lightly. In particular, be cautious about official-sounding requests for such information. These are
                often phishing scams as a legitimate financial institution will never ask you for such sensitive
                information in this way.</p>
              <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Simple actions to help you protect your money include checking your
                account regularly for fraudulent or
                erroneous charges, never sharing your banking information with anyone, and never accessing your
                financial accounts using public wifi that isn’t password protected. Additionally, if your debit card is
                stolen, report it immediately. You can call Member Services at (800) 666-0191 to report lost of stolen
                cards, or any unusual activity in your accounts. Check out our Security Center for more information.</p>

          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Balancing your account helps you stick to your budget and helps you avoid
            unnecessary charges resulting from bounced checks or overdraft fees. You can do this by manually comparing
            your monthly statements with your own records to make sure they balance. This also helps you spot any errors
            in the system, such as incorrectly charged fees.

            Cushion
          </h1>
          <p>While we understand that this is not always possible, it is good practice to always give yourself some
            breathing room in your account. Emergencies always happen without warning, so it’s always a good idea to
            ensure you have a readily accessible cash on hand. This is not only good practice for managing your checking
            account, but for your overall finances as well. Make a plan for emergencies by setting up an emergency fund.
            One useful tip is to set up online alerts when your account balance falls below a certain level. Setting up
            these Account Alerts is quick and easy. Account Alerts monitor your account every 10 minutes for new
            activity, ensuring you have real-time account information right at your fingertips.</p>

            Funds Availability</h1>
          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Under federal regulations, financial institutions are obligated to
            disclose their funds availability policy to their customers. The funds availability policy refers to how
            long it takes after you make a deposit for your funds to be available in your account. In general,
            electronic deposits, cash deposits, and certain types of checks (such as cashier’s checks or U.S. Treasury
            checks) are available within one business day. However, other types of checks may take a few business days
            to process, depending on your bank or credit union.

          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">At Bastion, we’re glad to help our members in all of their saving needs.
            A common mistake that people make is not factoring in funds availability when managing their accounts. This
            is a mistake that can lead to overdrawing your account and overdraft fees. It’s also why keeping a cash
            cushion in your checking account is so important.</p>
          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Here at Bastion, we offer two different types of checking accounts,
            including a free checking account. Each
            gives you access to a variety of online and mobile banking tools, so be sure to contact our team today to
            discuss which option is best suited to your needs.</p>
