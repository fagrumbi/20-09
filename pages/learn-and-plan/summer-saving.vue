                have been dreaming about all winter is just around the corner. Whether it’s an in-state trip to historic
                Gettysburg, a road trip to New York City or Boston, or a couple of weeks abroad, you’ve likely put some
                time into deciding where to go, how to get there, and how much you need to save to make it all happen.
                But saving for summer vacation isn’t easy—especially when you’re already putting money aside for big
                milestones like buying a house, your child’s education, or retirement.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 font-light">Deciding when to start saving for your vacation really comes down to
                how much you’re planning to spend—but it’s always best to start early. Regardless of the size of your
                budget, there are a number of things you can do to save money for your trip.</p>

                <p class="font-light text-gray-700">To start off, you need to figure out everything you’ll be paying
                  for—and how much you’ll be paying. Have you considered transport costs? What about accommodation and
                  food? Are you planning on a guided tour? Do you need camping equipment? And don’t forget about those
                  hidden costs like state taxes or currency exchange fees. Once you’ve done the math, you’ll have a
                  better idea of how much you need to pay upfront (e.g. for flights and reservations) and how much more
                  you’ll have to save until you leave.

                  Savings Account</h1>
                <p>One easy thing you can do to start putting money aside is open a savings account specifically for
                  your summer vacation. Like holiday club accounts—which people use to save for gift shopping,
                  traveling, and hosting events—a separate account will protect your vacation fund from being spent
                  elsewhere and let you focus on tracking how close you are to your goal. If your savings plan includes
                  putting a fixed amount towards your fund on every pay day, for instance, then you can set up automatic
                  payments from your checking account.

                Cut Back on Expenses</h1>
              <p class="font-light text-gray-700">A great summer vacation may mean having to reduce your spending in the
                months leading up to it. When you’re in the planning stages, take some time to review your online
                account for your spending habits and identify some key areas where you might cut back. If your family is
                prone to eating out, consider opting for home cooked meals—on average they are 69% cheaper than what you
                get at a restaurant. Other ways you can save include buying your groceries in bulk, exploring vintage or
                second-hand stores, and keeping an eye open for sales. While it may be hard to adjust to these
                practices, keep in mind that all the money you save will go towards your much deserved vacation.</p>

            Sell Unwanted Items</h1>
          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Decluttering can also help you boost your vacation savings. Take advantage
            of the spring weather and hold a garage sale to make money on the items you don’t use anymore. And if you
            need equipment for your vacation like tents, surfboards, or backpacks, save money by buying them secondhand
            or by exchanging the things you’re getting rid of in your local barter community.

            Refund
          </h1>
          <p>Your tax refund can also contribute to a vacation fund. As long as you file by April 15, it’s likely your
            refund will come in before summer starts. Since you’ll already have some insight into how big the refund is,
            you can have it automatically deposited into your account and adjust your savings plan accordingly. For
            other ideas on how to effectively use your refund and to make sure you’re getting the most out of tax
            return, you can always talk to your financial advisor.</p>

            Use Credit Card Rewards</h1>
          <p class="font-light text-gray-700">Whether you’re booking a flight or a hotel, summer vacation is an ideal
            time to put your credit card rewards to work. Consider changing your current credit card for a travel
            rewards program that lines up with your travel style. If you prefer having money in hand, you can also opt
            for a cashback rewards program that helps you save with every dollar you spend.
